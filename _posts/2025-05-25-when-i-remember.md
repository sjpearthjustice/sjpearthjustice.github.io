<h2>When I remember</h2>
When I remember,<br>
I imagine I'm a  cloud chamber.<br>
Christ falling right through me unflinching, in muon dust-trails<br>
hurtling amazed from eternities.<br><br>

When I remember<br>
I imagine being called forth like Lazarus.<br>
Crystallising and coagulating<br>
out of pupate oblivion,<br>
emerging sudden Eve<br>
alive from planetary clay.<br><br>

When I remember<br>
I imagine I'm winnowed by a vast breath<br>
circling a moonlit threshing floor.<br>
She ignites desert bushes and blows-open locked doors;<br>
exhaling unquenchable Pentecosts.<br><br>

Sara Mark, 2025
