<h1>Butterfly</h1>

Swarmed power swept by a fierce tail-wind<br>
high over chimneys, in flight<br>
from poison-fume<br>
smoke-gloom<br>
that pinned<br>
to starving death<br>
these beings winged with light<br>
who now break free and whirl above the earth<br><br><br>
A miracle was present in their making:<br>
egg, furry crawling larva, sheath.<br>
When were they birthed?<br>
Or we?<br>
To not-be<br>
pulped catafly<br>
pent inside a chrysalis, breaking<br>
out with damp and scarcely-quivering wings<br><br>
We look for them in summer, never dreaming<br>
these gleaming peacock-flies, so light-<br>
weight, so frail<br>
could sail<br>
at such a height<br>
nine thousand miles, with rests<br>
to feed, breed; each generation streaming<br>
closer towards home, towards their own land-nest<br>
