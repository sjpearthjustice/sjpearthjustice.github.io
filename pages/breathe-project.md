# Introduction

Air provides our most constant and intimate connection with the world around us. We swim in it, like fish in water, our lungs never ceasing their rhythmic swell and relax, 12 to 20 times every minute of our lives. Like those fish filtering water across their gills, we also interact with whatever is in that half-litre of air inspired with every breath. 

As a global society, we treat our shared air-ocean like an open sewer, filling it with gases, aerosols and particles. It seems that we pay less attention to this behaviour than we do to contamination of water and land which is perhaps more visible to us, because just slightly further removed. Perhaps we think air pollution will ‘blow away’ – wherever ‘away’ might be.

This project aims to investigate the air around us and our attitudes to it. Our starting point is measuring air-borne particulates at St James’s Piccadilly, in the heart of London. We have home-made sensors – an inspiring story in itself – installed in the church, the rectory, the garden and on the Piccadilly railings. We will analyse this data across the year, and use it as a jumping off point for reflections, liturgies, artwork and raising awareness.

# Pentecost

> Acts 2:2

At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit arrives like the sound of a mighty wind blowing through the locked room. Breath, the Holy Spirit, and pneuma - the ancient Greek word meaning both ‘spirit’ and ‘breath’ - are deeply interconnected, symbolizing life, presence, and divine inspiration.

The Holy Spirit is symbolised as wind or breath of God, or described as hovering over the waters, evoking images of protection and nurture, brooding like a parent bird over precious eggs. Across spiritual traditions, breath serves as a gateway, an invisible thread, bearing witness to the vital presence of Spirit. Breath is the bridge between matter and mystery—an elemental reminder that the sacred dwells within and around us, in every inhalation. When we breathe, we draw in more than air; we are in communion; receiving a touch of the sacred.

Air quality, then, is both a matter of physical health and a spiritual concern. Polluted air physically disrupts sacred connection, harming and killing. All over the planet, life is crying out ‘I can’t breathe’, suffocated and poisoned by the effects of human activity.

Clean air is a reverence, a way of honouring the divine that moves within and through us. To breathe freely is to remember: the holy is not distant, but close as breath, invisible as wind, present in every inhale, every exhale. When breath is compromised, so is our access to Spirit, intuition, and balance. In honouring clean air, we honour the Divine, and life itself.
